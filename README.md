# X-KeyPad-ZIBO-LEVELUP-737

## This is an X-KeyPad 1.5 virtual device configuration for the Zibo 737 and LevelUP 737NG. It was originally created by @magicnorm and posted by @markcellis in x-plane.org in order to help maintain and improve it over time.

The porting to X-KeyPad 1.5 was mainly done by @enjxp (https://forums.x-plane.org/index.php?/profile/535740-enjxp/) as he basically was maintaining the 1.4 version before, with support from @abuelo007X, and guidance and continues improvements of X-KeyPad 1.5 from @markcellis (https://forums.x-plane.org/index.php?/profile/223470-markcellis/)

This space has been created to facilitate a collaboration place to update is coding/configuration
