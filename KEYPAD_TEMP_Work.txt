	| FEATURE REQUESTS TO Stick & Rudder Studios |


OPERATORS : OR added to the existing
Operation using 2 or more datarefs as input : add / substract / divide / multiply

[OK]	- Ability to change ACTIVE Unit tab label color
[OK]	- Extract part of any dataref string from both Key Label and Formula Expression
[OK]	- More SharedString are required (currently limited to 10)
[OK]	- Font scaling
[OK]	- ADD MULTIPLE/ADDITIONAL Combined comparison lines from different datarefs for KEYS Color or FONT Color
[OK]	- Values in a range


	| KEEP IN MIND |


	LUA - First Running - Initial pass / Compare to Memorized value to avoid forwarding useless updates to the sim,
			however in some case we should update with do_every_frame in order to avoid the ISSUE where the values are not dispkayed on INIT (LOAD)
	
	EFB HOME and EFB PAYLOAD PAGE - This Keys in the FLIGHT Unit, in order to work properly, requires to establish a quickview and add as and additional command to the Keys 0 and 9
			Just click "Add command" on the "Command" section of the key with "Single" action option, and add a "sim/view/quick_look_<key number>"
			In my case (@abuelo007X) I use the 7 key to move to the EFB so I use "sim/view/quick_look_7"
			Currently when you press the EFB and PAYLOAD keys, change the view inside the EFB but does not focus the camera to it, unless the command is added as mentioned


	| MENTION |


	Thanks @Abuelo007X for having initiated the boost on this project, making it going far ahead and indeed for your tremendous work.
                        I must admit that I had difficulties at first to follow the quickness with which you are coding on adding and fixing parts,
                        which today, helped me really to gain a different method for coding. This added more additional night time for coding, however I really like where this project is going
                        Many Thanks again for your valuable contribution and your help
