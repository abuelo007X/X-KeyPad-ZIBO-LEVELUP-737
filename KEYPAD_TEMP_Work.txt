	| FEATURE REQUESTS TO Stick & Rudder Studios |


OPERATORS : OR added to the existing
Operation using 2 or more datarefs as input : add / substract / divide / multiply

[OK]	- Ability to change ACTIVE Unit tab label color
[OK]	- Extract part of any dataref string from both Key Label and Formula Expression
[OK]	- More SharedString are required (currently limited to 10)
[OK]	- Font scaling
[OK]	- ADD MULTIPLE/ADDITIONAL Combined comparison lines from different datarefs for KEYS Color or FONT Color
[OK]	- Values in a range


	| KEEP IN MIND |

	EN: PACKAGE FORWARDING : Before any package forwarding, either to the current dev team or to Mark Cellis,
								any change from one of each X-Keys_b738_4k.json or X-Keys_b738.json file, should be replicated to the other,
								in order to avoid any confusion while handled by any other memeber of the dev team,
								or by Mark Cellis on receiving the package for validation

	EN: TXT File ADDED in the ZIP file root folder, to track the current ZIP Keypad set release number,
						in order to properly follow each package submission

		- !!!!! Currently the naming is as follow !!!!! : "version_1.0.8.25_Beta.txt" and will become "version_1.0.8.txt" on final release
		- The main release number here is "1.0.8" and each intermediate Beta is increased by the last number, here ".25" with "_Beta" added,
			before any final release, where these specific infos will be symply suppressed in the filename
			The increment is made just on receiving a duplicated forwarded, or on a duplicated downloaded package (before forwarding any package)
			
			Beta's increment:
			-----------------
			version_1.0.8.25_Beta.txt
			version_1.0.8.26_Beta.txt
			version_1.0.8.27_Beta.txt
			...
			...
			version_1.0.8.1729_Beta.txt
			...
			
			Final on releasing :
			--------------------
			version_1.0.8.txt
			
		- The folder should be named the same manner at the end, like this : "X-KeyPad-ZIBO-LEVELUP-737_1.0.8.25_Beta"

	EN: LUA - First Running - Initial pass / Compare to Memorized value to avoid forwarding useless updates to the sim,
			however in some case we should update with do_every_frame in order to avoid the ISSUE where the values are not dispkayed on INIT (LOAD)
	
	AB: EFB HOME and EFB PAYLOAD PAGE - These Keys in the FLIGHT Unit, requires to establish a quickview command and add as an additional command to the Keys 0 and 9
			Just click "Add command" on the "Command" section of the key with "Single" action option, and add a "sim/view/quick_look_<key number>" if using x-plane views
			In my case (@abuelo007X) I use the 7 key to move to the EFB so I use "sim/view/quick_look_7", so is the one configured in this version
			Currently when you press the EFB and PAYLOAD keys, change the view inside the EFB and by default using quick_look_7, but may not work in your case.
			Just change with the corresponding quickview command to the tablet that you use, using standard x-plane or any other mod


	| MENTION |


	EN: Thanks @Abuelo007X for having initiated the boost on this project, making it going far ahead and indeed for your tremendous work.
                        I must admit that I had difficulties at first to follow the quickness with which you are coding on adding and fixing parts,
                        which today, helped me really to gain a different method for coding. This added more additional night time for coding,
						however I really like where this project was going
                        Many Thanks again for your valuable contribution and your help
